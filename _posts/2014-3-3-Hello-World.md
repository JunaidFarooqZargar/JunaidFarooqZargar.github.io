Hi, I'm Junaid

Welcome to my website.

I am an engineer, researcher, and technology enthusiast. I have bachelors and masters degrees in Electrical Engineering from National Institute of Technology (NIT) Srinagar. Recently, I completed a PhD degree in Artificial Intelligence at NIT Srinagar under the supervision of  Prof. Mohammad Abid Bazaz.

My research work mainly involves development and integration of various artificial intelligence and deep learning techniques to achieve advances in computational intelligence with applications in NLP, generative modelling, and data science.

I strongly believe that the future of technology will be at the intersection of artificial intelligence and human intelligence.
